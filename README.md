# Differences from the Reading Time Plugin

This plugin is based on great [reading-time plugin](https://github.com/avr/obsidian-reading-time), which focuses primarily on writing and helping users manage note length. While the underlying structure is similar, this version is designed for a different use case â€” reading.
It estimates the time remaining to finish reading a text (such as articles, notes, or books), providing a smoother reading experience and helping users pace their reading sessions.

In short:

[Reading Time Plugin](https://github.com/avr/obsidian-reading-time): Optimized for writing and keeping notes concise.

This plugin: Optimized for reading and tracking reading progress/time left.
