## How to install the plugin

- Extract the `obsidian-reading-time` folder from the zip to your vault `<vault>/.obsidian/plugins/`

## Contributing
=======
This plugin is based on great [reading-time plugin](https://github.com/avr/obsidian-reading-time), which focuses primarily on writing and helping users manage note length. While the underlying structure is similar, this version is designed for a different use case â€” reading.
It estimates the time remaining to finish reading a text (such as articles, notes, or books), providing a smoother reading experience and helping users pace their reading sessions.

In short:
Reading Time Plugin: Optimized for writing and keeping notes concise.
